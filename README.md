Dart-JavaScript Interop
=======================

package:js provides high-level, typed interopability between Dart and
JavaScript. It allows developers to export Dart APIs to JavaScript and define
well-typed interfaces for JavaScript objects.

Status
------

Version 0.3.0 is a complete rewrite of package:js as described in the
package:js 1.0 [design document][design].

The development plan is to build out the first release of this new version of
package:js and publish as 0.3.0, then rapidly release new versions as
development progresses using semantic versioning, but shifting the meaning of
the version number one to the right. This means that 0.4.0 will be a breaking
change in some way from 0.3.0. Version 1.0 will signify that the features and
API have stabilized.
